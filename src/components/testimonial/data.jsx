        "Sunny has proven to be an outstanding co-op student by being recognized as a full-time-equivalent member of the team. Work assigned to Sunny is done with ease knowing that Sunny is capable of briefing on the problem up front and working on the solution independently. She also shows great ownership overfeatures she has worked on by hopping onto bugs created or features requested immediately. Anecdotally, when her coworkers see work assigned to her, they can feel safe knowing they do not have to check in on her progress worrying that she is struggling, complacent, or writing poor quality code. All of her accomplishments ultimately stem from her intangibles, such as her enthusiasm to identify opportunities to work on newer skills and persistent desire for feedback. There's no doubt that she has the capacity to grow quickly."
